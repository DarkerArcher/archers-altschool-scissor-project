# A URL Shortening and QR Code Generation Web Application

## Technologies Used
This application was built with VueJS and TypeScript. Firebase was used to implement the user authentication process, and the APIs used to build the tools can be found at https://goqr.me/api/doc/ for the QR Code generator and https://shrtco.de/docs for the shortened link creator. Additionally, I implemented a feature to copy the generated short link to clipboard, and the tool can be found at https://github.com/JamieCurnow/vue-clipboard3.
